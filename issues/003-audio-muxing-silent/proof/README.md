# Issue 003 — Audio Muxing (Silent Output) Investigation

## Status: Not a bug — source asset was silent

The original report stated that rendered MP4 files contained no audible sound. After investigation:

1. `ffprobe` confirmed the output MP4 **does** contain a valid AAC audio stream (`Stream #0:1: Audio: aac`).
2. The source file `assets/sample.mp3` is a 79KB, 10-second, mono MP3 encoded at 56 kbps — it contains only silence (generated by `Lavf` as a placeholder).
3. The FFmpeg filter chain (`adelay → volume → amix`) executes correctly and the audio is properly interleaved.

## How to verify

```bash
cd issues/003-audio-muxing-silent/proof

# Use a real audio file with actual sound
vidra render test.vidra --output result.mp4
# or 
/Users/mohamedahmed/Downloads/Projects/dev/vidra/target/release/vidra render test.vidra --output result.mp4

# Confirm audio stream exists
ffprobe result.mp4
```

**Conclusion:** The `vidra-encode` crate handles audio muxing correctly. The silence was caused by the test asset, not the engine. No code change was required.
