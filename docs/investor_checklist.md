# Investor Safe Claims Checklist

Last updated: 2026-02-24  
Purpose: Fast pre-send review for decks, memos, and investor emails

## 1) Source-of-Truth Check (Must Pass)
- Every numeric claim has a traceable source file, run log, contract, or finance export.
- Every performance claim references methodology and environment context.
- Every customer/commercial claim references signed evidence (contract, PO, or verifiable usage source).
- Any forward-looking metric is explicitly labeled forward-looking.

## 2) Red Flags (Must Be Removed)
- Absolute language: guaranteed, always, never fails, industry-leading (without independent proof).
- Competitor comparisons without date, method, and comparable test setup.
- Revenue/growth projections presented as outcomes instead of scenarios.
- Security/compliance claims without published artifacts.

## 3) Performance Claims Review
- Claim text matches current benchmark evidence exactly.
- Hardware + OS + build profile are listed.
- Scene/workload used for benchmarks is identified.
- Claim includes variability caveat for customer environments.
- Claim avoids implying SLA/contractual guarantee.

## 4) Commercial Claims Review
- Pipeline claims distinguish: discussion, pilot, signed, live revenue.
- Customer logos are permission-cleared.
- Revenue numbers reconcile to finance source of truth.
- Retention/churn claims include cohort period and calculation method.

## 5) Legal/Compliance Guardrails
- Add forward-looking statement block in deck or memo.
- Add risk factors for technical, market, and execution uncertainty.
- Confirm no statement can be interpreted as investment guarantee.
- Obtain legal review before external circulation.

## 6) Reviewer Sign-Off (Required)
- Product/Engineering reviewer:
